    "Suppose you have a dataset containing the heights of students in a classroom. Descriptive statistics can be used to calculate measures such as the mean height, median height, mode height, and standard deviation of heights in the dataset. These measures provide a summary of the distribution of heights in the classroom without making any inferences about the larger population.\n",

    "Example:\n",
    "Imagine you are conducting a survey to determine the average income of households in a city. You collect income data from a random sample of households and calculate the sample mean income. Using inferential statistics, you can then estimate the population mean income and determine the level of confidence in your estimate. Additionally, you can perform hypothesis tests to assess whether there is a significant difference in income between different demographic groups within the population."

    "Education level (e.g., high school diploma, bachelor's degree, master's degree)\n",
    "Interval Data:\n",

    "Q7 Nominal and ordinal data types are both categories of qualitative data, but they differ in terms of the nature of the categories and the level of measurement they represent. Here are the key differences between nominal and ordinal data types:\n",
    "\n",
    "Nature of Categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "Nominal Data: In nominal data, categories represent distinct labels or names with no inherent order or ranking. The categories are simply different from each other, and there is no notion of one category being greater or lesser than another.\n",
    "Ordinal Data: In ordinal data, categories also represent distinct labels, but there is a natural order or ranking among the categories. The categories have a relative ranking, indicating the order of importance, preference, or magnitude.\n",
    "Level of Measurement:\n",
    "\n",
    "Nominal Data: Nominal data is at the lowest level of measurement. It involves categorizing or classifying observations into distinct groups or classes without any implied ranking or order. Nominal data only provides information about the identity or classification of the observations.\n",
    "Ordinal Data: Ordinal data is at a higher level of measurement compared to nominal data. It not only categorizes observations into distinct groups but also provides information about the relative order or ranking of the categories. However, the intervals between the categories may not be equal, and the differences between categories may not be quantifiable.\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "Nominal Data Example: Eye color (e.g., blue, brown, green) is an example of nominal data. The categories represent distinct labels with no inherent order or ranking. Each category is simply a different color, and there is no notion of one color being greater or lesser than another.\n",
    "Ordinal Data Example: Educational attainment (e.g., high school diploma, bachelor's degree, master's degree) is an example of ordinal data. The categories represent distinct levels of education with a natural order or ranking. While there is a ranking among the categories (e.g., master's degree > bachelor's degree > high school diploma), the exact differences between categories may not be quantifiable."
