    "Q1 A database is a structured collection of data that is organized in a way that enables efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data. It serves as a central repository for storing and managing information, allowing users or applications to interact with the data in various ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two broad categories of database management systems (DBMS) that differ in their data models, querying languages, and design philosophies.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Model: SQL databases, also known as relational databases, organize data into tables consisting of rows and columns. Each table represents an entity, and the columns represent attributes of that entity. Relationships between entities are established using foreign keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema: SQL databases typically enforce a predefined schema, meaning the structure of the database, including the tables, columns, and data types, must be specified in advance. Changes to the schema can be complex and often require downtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Query Language: SQL databases use SQL as the standard language for querying and manipulating data. SQL provides a rich set of operations for data retrieval, insertion, updating, and deletion, along with capabilities for data aggregation, sorting, and joining tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transactions: SQL databases offer strong transactional support, ensuring data integrity and consistency through features like ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: SQL databases traditionally scale vertically, meaning they can handle increased loads by upgrading the hardware resources of a single server. While some SQL databases support sharding or replication for horizontal scaling, it may require additional complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Model: NoSQL databases employ various data models, including document-oriented, key-value, columnar, and graph databases. These models are more flexible and allow for storing unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema: NoSQL databases typically have a flexible schema or schema-less design, allowing developers to store different types of data in the same database without the need for a predefined schema. This flexibility simplifies iterative development and accommodates evolving data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Query Language: NoSQL databases may use different query languages specific to their data model, such as MongoDB's query language for document databases or Cassandra Query Language (CQL) for columnar databases. These languages are often more tailored to the database's specific data model compared to SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transactions: NoSQL databases offer varying levels of transactional support, with some providing eventual consistency rather than immediate consistency. This trade-off allows for greater scalability and performance in distributed environments but may require application-level handling of data consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: NoSQL databases are designed for horizontal scalability, allowing them to handle large volumes of data and high traffic loads by distributing data across multiple nodes in a cluster. This scalability makes them well-suited for modern web applications and big data environments"

    "Q2 DDL stands for Data Definition Language, which is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used for defining and managing the structure of a database schema. DDL statements are used to create, modify, and delete database objects such as tables, indexes, and constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an explanation of the commonly used DDL statements and their purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE: The CREATE statement is used to create new database objects such as tables, views, indexes, and constraints. It specifies the name of the object being created, along with its structure and any initial settings. For example:\n",
    "CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "    id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    name VARCHAR(100),\n",
    "    department VARCHAR(50)\n",
    ");\n",
    "This statement creates a new table named \"employees\" with columns for employee ID, name, and department.\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP: The DROP statement is used to delete existing database objects such as tables, views, indexes, and constraints. It removes the specified object from the database schema, along with all associated data and dependencies. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP TABLE employees;\n",
    "This statement deletes the \"employees\" table from the database schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER: The ALTER statement is used to modify the structure of existing database objects. It allows you to add, modify, or drop columns, constraints, and other properties of tables and other objects. For example:\n",
    "ALTER TABLE employees\n",
    "ADD COLUMN salary DECIMAL(10,2);\n",
    "This statement adds a new column named \"salary\" to the \"employees\" table.\n",
    "\n",
    "TRUNCATE: The TRUNCATE statement is used to remove all rows from a table, effectively resetting the table to an empty state while retaining its structure and metadata. Unlike the DROP statement, TRUNCATE does not delete the table itself, only its data. For example:\n",
    "TRUNCATE TABLE employees;\n",
    "This statement removes all rows from the \"employees\" table, but the table structure remains intact."

    "Q3 DML stands for Data Manipulation Language, which is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used for managing data within a database. DML statements are used to insert, update, delete, and retrieve data from tables. Here's an explanation of the commonly used DML statements and their purposes, along with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "INSERT: The INSERT statement is used to add new rows of data into a table. It specifies the table name and the values to be inserted into each column of the table. For example:\n",
    "INSERT INTO employees (id, name, department, salary)\n",
    "VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 'IT', 50000);\n",
    "This statement inserts a new row into the \"employees\" table with values for the \"id\", \"name\", \"department\", and \"salary\" columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "UPDATE: The UPDATE statement is used to modify existing data in a table. It specifies the table name, the columns to be updated, and the new values for those columns, along with an optional condition to specify which rows to update. For example:\n",
    "UPDATE employees\n",
    "SET salary = 55000\n",
    "WHERE id = 1;\n",
    "This statement updates the \"salary\" column of the \"employees\" table to 55000 for the row where the \"id\" column equals 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "DELETE: The DELETE statement is used to remove one or more rows of data from a table. It specifies the table name and an optional condition to specify which rows to delete. If no condition is specified, all rows in the table will be deleted. For example:\n",
    "DELETE FROM employees\n",
    "WHERE id = 1;"

    "Q4 DQL stands for Data Query Language, which is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used for querying and retrieving data from a database. DQL statements are primarily used to fetch data from one or more tables based on specific criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most commonly used DQL statement is SELECT, which retrieves data from one or more tables and returns the result as a result set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an explanation of the SELECT statement with an example:\n",
    "SELECT column1, column2, ...\n",
    "FROM table_name\n",
    "WHERE condition;\n",
    "column1, column2, ...: These are the columns from which you want to retrieve data. You can specify one or more columns separated by commas, or you can use the asterisk (*) to select all columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "table_name: This is the name of the table from which you want to retrieve data.\n",
    "\n",
    "condition: This is an optional clause that allows you to specify conditions that must be met for the rows to be included in the result set. Conditions can be based on column values, comparison operators, logical operators, etc.\n",

    "Q5 Primary Key:\n",
    "\n",
    "A primary key is a column or a set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in the table.\n",
    "It must contain unique values, meaning no two rows in the table can have the same value for the primary key column(s).\n",
    "By definition, a primary key column cannot contain NULL values.\n",
    "Primary keys are used to enforce entity integrity in a relational database model, ensuring that each record in a table can be uniquely identified.\n",
    "Typically, primary keys are implemented using indexes to facilitate fast data retrieval.\n",
    "Example: In a table named \"students,\" the \"student_id\" column could serve as the primary key, uniquely identifying each student record.\n",
    "Foreign Key:\n",
    "\n",
    "A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in a table that establishes a relationship between two tables.\n",
    "It represents a field (or a set of fields) in one table that refers to the primary key in another table.\n",
    "Foreign key constraints enforce referential integrity by ensuring that the values in the foreign key column(s) correspond to existing values in the primary key column(s) of the referenced table.\n",
    "Foreign keys help maintain data consistency and integrity by preventing actions that would result in orphaned or invalid data.\n",
    "Example: In a table named \"orders,\" the \"customer_id\" column could serve as a foreign key, referencing the \"customer_id\" primary key column in a \"customers\" table. This ensures that each order in the \"orders\" table is associated with a valid customer in the \"customers\" table.\n"
