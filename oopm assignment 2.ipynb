    "Q2 Abstraction and encapsulation are two fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP), but they serve different purposes and address different aspects of software design.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction focuses on hiding the implementation details of a class and showing only the essential features of the object. It allows programmers to deal with objects at a higher level without worrying about the internal complexities.\n",
    "Abstraction is achieved through abstract classes, interfaces, and methods, which define a set of operations or behaviors without specifying how those operations are implemented.\n",
    "It emphasizes what an object does rather than how it does it, promoting a clear separation of concerns and simplifying the overall design.\n",
    "Encapsulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes or properties) and methods (functions or procedures) that operate on the data into a single unit, often referred to as a class. It hides the internal state of an object from the outside world and only exposes a controlled interface for interacting with that object.\n",
    "Encapsulation protects the integrity of the data by preventing direct access and manipulation from external code. Instead, access to the data is mediated through methods, allowing for better control and validation of the data.\n",
    "It helps in achieving information hiding, reducing coupling between components, and enhancing code maintainability and reusability.\n",
