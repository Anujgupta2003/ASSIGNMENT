    "The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, called a class. This unit restricts access to some of its components, preventing direct modification, and provides a clear interface for interacting with the object. Encapsulation helps in achieving data hiding and abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of hiding the complex implementation details of an object and exposing only the necessary features or behaviors to the outside world. It allows programmers to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it. Abstraction helps in managing complexity by providing a simplified view of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class (subclass or derived class) is created from an existing class (superclass or base class), inheriting its attributes and methods. The subclass can extend or modify the behavior of the superclass by adding new features or overriding existing ones. Inheritance promotes code reusability and supports the concept of hierarchical classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism means the ability of a single interface (method or function) to be used for different types of data or objects. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass through method overriding or method overloading. Polymorphism enables dynamic binding and facilitates flexibility and extensibility in OOP design."

    "Q3 In object-oriented programming (OOP), the __init__() function is a special method used for initializing newly created objects. It is called automatically when a new instance of a class is created. The primary purpose of the __init__() method is to set up the initial state of an object by initializing its attributes with values provided during object creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's why the __init__() function is used:\n",
    "\n",
    "Initializing Object State: The __init__() method allows you to define how the object's attributes should be initialized when a new instance of the class is created. This ensures that the object starts with a known and appropriate state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameter Passing: The __init__() method can accept parameters that are passed during object creation. These parameters can be used to initialize specific attributes of the object based on the provided values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic Invocation: The __init__() method is automatically invoked when a new instance of the class is created using the class name followed by parentheses containing any required arguments. This simplifies the process of object initialization and ensures consistency in object creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Customization: The __init__() method can be customized to perform additional tasks during object initialization, such as performing validation checks, setting default values for attributes, or even creating other objects as part of the initialization process\n",
    "\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",

    "person1.display_info()  # Output: Name: Alice, Age: 30\n",
    "person2.display_info()  # Output: Name: Bob, Age: 25\n",
    "In this example, the __init__() method of the Person class initializes the name and age attributes of each Person object based on the values provided during object creation. This ensures that each Person object starts with the specified name and age."

    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), self is a special keyword that is used to represent the instance of the class within the class itself. It is a convention in many object-oriented programming languages, such as Python, to use self as the first parameter of instance methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's why self is used in OOP:\n",
    "\n",
    "Instance Reference: When a method is called on an object, self refers to the specific instance of the class on which the method is being invoked. It allows the method to access and manipulate the attributes and methods of that particular instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differentiating Instance Variables: Within a class, self is used to distinguish between instance variables (attributes) and local variables or parameters. Instance variables are accessed using self.variable_name, which helps in clearly identifying and accessing the attributes associated with the instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Method Invocation: By convention, instance methods in OOP languages take self as the first parameter. When a method is called on an object, the object itself is automatically passed as the self argument to the method. This enables the method to operate on the specific instance of the class.\n",

    "Q5 Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a new class (subclass or derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (superclass or base class).
